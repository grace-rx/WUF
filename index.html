      <p class="text-center">We United Foundation is a non-profit charity organization dedicated to connecting youth with community service opportunities, encouraging teens and international students to volunteer, and providing leadership training for teens through supporting the community.</p>

    <div class="section full-width-section bg-color-2">
      <h2 class="text-center">Our Story</h2>
      <p class="text-center">We began our journey as 5th graders volunteering with the Super Joey Foundation, an organization that supports kids with cancer. After being inspired by the visible difference our work made, our efforts quickly grew and we started organizing various fundraising events every year. Up till today, the funds we raised have supported over 30 events that directly benefit children with severe illnesses.</p>
      <p class="text-center">Over the years, our team has kept expanding and now includes members from 8+ schools on the East Coast. In 2023, we founded We United Foundation (WUF) with the intention of using our volunteering experience to influence and support new members who want to use their unique interests to make a positive impact. We United Foundation is not only a non-profit organization dedicated to serving kids with severe diseases, but also a community that supports youths wanting to develop themselves through community service.</p>

                <p class="text-center">"We United Foundation, for me, has been a gateway to helping the community while also making close bonds. I’ve made numerous close friends and interacting with them has actually made me actively look forward to every service. From the time I joined until now, I haven’t missed a single service, not just because I love serving food that much, but because of how engaging and fun the others in We United make it. Through We United, I have found something that I can be proud of being a part of, while also having fun and enjoying myself." - Kyle Li</p>

Through our activities, I helped children with cancer and their families, deepening my understanding of helping others. This summer, I returned to China but continued my volunteer work. We spending time with the children in the hospital and bringing them joy and hope. This experience made me cherish health and life even more and showed me that love and care know no borders. The We United Foundation has greatly benefited me in the United States and allowed me to continue spreading love and care in China." - Jingjing Han</p>

                  <p class="text-center">"At sjf, I have had some of the most reflective and interesting experiences while volunteering. Through meal prepping, I learned valuable organizational as well as collaborative skills, which not only made me a better volunteer, but also allowed me to use these skills in my daily life. Interacting with the patients at rmh was also an eye opening experience. Through face painting sessions with the children, I learned how to better communicate and care for kids. To summarize, volunteering for sjf was one of the most transformative things I’ve done in my life."</p>
